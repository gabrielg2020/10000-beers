## Read First
Before starting any task, read these files in order:
1. `docs/agent/design-principles.md` — the goal of the project and core philosophy
2. `docs/agent/beer-submission-flow.md` — the core flow and why it is ordered the way it is
3. The relevant scoped file for the area you are working in:
   - `docs/agent/commands-and-permissions.md` — working on commands
   - `docs/agent/image-handling.md` — working on image processing
   - `docs/agent/ai-classification.md` — working on AI validation
   - `docs/agent/database.md` — working on schema or queries
   - `docs/agent/error-handling.md` — working on error handling
   - `docs/agent/chrome-and-whatsapp.md` — working on WhatsApp client or session
   - `docs/agent/testing.md` — writing tests
   - `docs/agent/deployment.md` — working on Docker or deployment
 
Do not skip this step. These files contain the business context and decisions that are not visible from the code alone.
 
## Project
WhatsApp bot for tracking beer consumption in a group chat. Users send photos of beers, bot logs them with optional AI classification.
 
**Tech stack:** TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, WhatsApp Web (puppeteer), Google Gemini AI (optional)
 
**Human documentation:** See [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/gabrielg2020/10000-beers/wiki) for setup guides and architecture overview.
 
## Quick Setup
1. `npm install`
2. Configure `.env` (see `.env.example`)
3. `npm run dev` and scan QR code
4. Session persists in `.wwebjs_auth/session-10000-beers/`

## Tooling
- **Biome** for linting and formatting — do not suggest ESLint or Prettier
- **Jest** with ts-jest for testing
- **Docker** and docker-compose for deployment
- **PostgreSQL 16** with Prisma ORM
- **Pino** for structured logging
 
## Key Services
Always use existing services rather than duplicating logic:
 
- `beerService` — beer submission, duplicate detection, removal
- `userService` — user creation, lookup, beer counts
- `imageService` — image processing, validation, storage, hashing
- `aiService` — Gemini AI beer classification
- `statisticsService` — leaderboard calculations
- `commandRegistry` — command registration and execution
 
## Code Style
- Tabs for indentation, single quotes, named exports only
- Always use explicit type annotations
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- Comments sparingly, only where needed
- Biome auto-formats on save
 
## Commands
- `!undo` — remove last beer submission (10-minute window, own submissions only)
- `!leaderboard` (aliases: `!lb`, `!top`) — show rankings (admin only)
  - `!lb day` — today
  - `!lb week` — this week (Monday to now)
  - `!lb month` — this month
  - `!lb weekend` — this weekend (Fri-Sun) or last weekend (Mon-Thu)
- `!removeLast @user` — remove a user's last beer (admin only, no time restriction)
- `!release` — show latest release notes from GitHub (admin only)
- `!stats <period>` — show group drinking statistics (everyone can use)
  - `!stats day` — today + last 24 hours
  - `!stats week` — this week + last 7 days
  - `!stats month` — this month + last 30 days
  - `!stats weekend` — this weekend + last weekend (Fri-Sun), or only last weekend (Mon-Thu)
 
## Configuration
Environment variables control all bot behaviour. Required: `DATABASE_URL`, `WHATSAPP_GROUP_ID`
 
## Do Not
- Rewrite working functions unless asked
- Change error handling patterns without flagging
- Add new dependencies without asking
- Rename files or reorganise folders without explicit instruction
- Read `.env` files
- Use the `any` type
- Suggest ESLint or Prettier (use Biome)
- Remove or rename unused database fields without asking — several exist intentionally for future features
- Refactor or clean up code that is not directly related to the current task
